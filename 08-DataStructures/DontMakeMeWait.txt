Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait in vain, to love you
Can't wait to give you mi last name
Don't make me wait, don't make me too long, girl
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love, to love you
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love, to love you
A wah mi say

It didn't take me long to fall in love with your mind
And I won't even mention the way your body perfectly design, so fine
And judging from your outlook on life, I knew this would be more than jus' one night
But now I'm ready for the next level and you're telling me you need more time
No crime, nothing wrong with waitin' a little bit
You know this is more to me than jus' hittin' it
But you only get a love like this once in a lifetime
And if this is our chance I ain't missing it
My whole life I ain't felt like this, jus' wanna run I don't wanna fight this
I ain't rushin' you to make up your mind, jus' wanna put some more quality in a we time
Come on, girl!

Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love, to love you
I can't wait no fi love ya
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love, to love you

I don't want you to think I'm rushin' you
I know you like to take your time (time, time)
I'm already sold on the idea, of you and I
Just tell me where I need to sign
'Cause I've been searching for a while, girl
And I know what works for me (oh, oh)
All I need to know if this is what you want, girl
'Cause I'm already where I need to be
So don't make me wait

Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love, to love you
I can't wait no longer
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love, to love you
Say wah

You don't wanna rush and I don't wanna take my time
I'm putting everything on the line
They say that true love's hard to find
I'm ready now to make you mine

Don't make me wait
Baby, now, baby, now, don't make me wait
You gotta say yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't make me wait
Baby, now, baby, now, don't make me wait
